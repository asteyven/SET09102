# Test battles

*Under development*

The format of this week's practical is slightly different from the others. You will be 
working in your team, but rather than collaborating on the main project, you will be 
competing against another team. You will be provided with a new repository specifically
for the competition which contains a set of simple issues that require implementation. 

In the first part of the exercise, one team will have the job of implementing the code
for the issues and the second team will have the job of writing unit tests. At the end of
the coding period, the tests will be run against the code. If the code for an issue passes
all the tests written by the other team, the first team gets a point; if the code fails 
one or more tests, the testing team gets a point. In the second part of the session, the 
roles are reversed. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end.

Both teams will have some time at the start to get set up with the new repository. The team
doing the coding have the right to create their own unit tests, but only the ones from the
opposing team will be used in the final contest.
