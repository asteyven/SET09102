# Code review

This week sees a break from the teamwork. Instead, you will be completing a series
of online code review challenges. For each challenge, you need to identify the 
problems with a code snippet and suggest a way to fix them. The challenges increase
in difficulty as you go through the series. You will accumulate a points score as 
you go through them - don't skip ahead, otherwise you will miss out on points from
the early ones.

You can access the code review challenges here:

## Identifying problems

Some of the problems should be easy to spot. For the more difficult ones you may need
to make use of some of the reference material provided in the notes.

## Suggesting fixes

Points are awarded for spotting the problems, but not for your suggested fixes. However,
it is important to know what an appropriate solution looks like. You will need your
suggested fixes for your portfolio entry this week. You will also be able to discuss 
then with the module tutor and refer to them in the end-of-module interview.

## Documentation

At the end of the week, the team needs to review their workflow documentation to include
the code review stage. The `workflow.md` file needs to be updated with clear instructions
for how to 

* assign a reviewer
* perform the code review
* respond to a code review
* close an issue
