# UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) App

## Introduction

UNDAC teams are deployed by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs ([OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/)) of the United Nations (UN) to parts of the 
world affected by natural or socio-political disasters to provide humanitarian 
assistance. This primarily takes the form of food, shelter and medical supplies. The 
centre of operations for an UNDAC team is the On-Site Operations Coordination Centre 
(OSOCC).

The system you have been asked to build aims to provide all UNDAC team members with 
the functions they need to manage their role. 

The (simplified) operational structure of an UNDAC team is shown in the figure 1.

provides comprehensive details on the operation of a team. 

## Technical notes

The system is potentially large and complex and an agile approach will be taken to 
deliver essential features quickly and to add further features incrementally over time.
The system is envisaged as a stand-alone, cross-platform application that communicates 
with a remote database for sharing information among users. This architecture has been 
chosen because an internet connection cannot be guaranteed, and the application must 
continue to operate in isolation if necessary.

The .NET framework has been selected as the development environment with C# as the main 
programming language. Cross-platform compatibility will be achieved by using the .NET 
Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) framework.

Initial design work has already been completed for some of the basic features and your 
team will be provided with the following in week 3 of the trimester

* A set of documented user stories
* An installation of SQL Server to use as a shared database

As a team, you will need to work through the backlog of user stories as directed during 
the practical sessions. Please note that there is no benefit to doing a larger number 
of users stories than is required. All the marks are for product and process quality, 
not quantity.
