# Project work

In weeks 6 - 12, the practical exercise is directly related to the team project. 

A series of issues have been provided in the form of  
[user stories](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories) related
to the [UNDAC app project](scenario.md). Over the next three weeks, you need to work 
them at a comfortable pace. The purpose of the exercise is to develop a reliable process
and not to finish all the issues. As a team, you decide on the priority associated with 
each issue.

Some of the issues are quite large and complex and may need to be split into separate tasks. 
This 
[PluralSight article](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/break-down-agile-user-stories-into-tasks-and-estimate-level-of-effort)
illustrates how to do this with an example. For the purposes of this exercise, if you 
decide to split an issue, the smaller tasks should be added to the backlog as issues in
their own right so that they can be assigned to different people. You should add a 
[task list](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists)
to the original issue that lists all the smaller tasks. As each smaller task is completed,
it should be ticked off on the original list. 

Note that as a general rule, a task should take around a day to complete. That means it
is not too simple or too complex. This rule of thumb is genersally used in Scrum projects.

As well as the user stories, you may identify additional tasks such as refactoring that 
should be done to improve the structure of the code. An example could be to add a database 
manager class to eliminate the repeated code in the database access operations that were 
written in week 3.

At the start of each of the three weeks, the team should plan which user stories and 
additional tasks will be attempted, and who will do them. This should be recorded on
your team's task board.

Each week, each person on the team should 

* accept an issue from the backlog
* follow the team workflow through to pull request
* add documentation comments following the rules in the team's `doxygen.md` file
* review someone else's work
* fix any problems identified in the review of your own code

The idea is to put into practice all the aspects that we have looked at so far. With each 
issue that you deal with you should be looking for ways to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the work. That includes

* Your personal skills with code design, unit testing, documentation and code review
* The processes that your team has adopted

At the start of each week, the team should review the agreed processes including workflow, 
communication, documentation, etc. to identify opportunities to improve them. Changes 
should be captured in a new version of the documentation file `workflow.md`. Once changes
have been made, all team members are expected to follow the new procedures.
