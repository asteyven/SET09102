# Requirements definition

*Under development*

So far, you have been working with specifications that have been created by someone else.
You have probably found gaps, inconsistencies and in some case, actual errors. This 
demonstrates the need for clear specifications of requirements for developers to work on.
This is where you have the opportunity to see whether you can create specification 
documents that are as good if not better than the ones you have been working with so far.

Each person on the team will be given a user story with no specification at all. Your task 
is to elaborate the user story so that it can be assigned to someone else for implementation. 

## Elaboration
