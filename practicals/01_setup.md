# Setup: Visual Studio and GitHub

*Under development*

Several of the practical exercises in this module require you to work as part of a team.
The goal this week is to ensure that everyone has a properly-configured working 
environment. That includes 

* Creating a shared GitHub repository for the team
* Setting up a project in GitHub with an integrated task board
* Configuring a personal copy of Visual Studio appropriately
* Cloning the shared repository

That is the extent of the practical work. However, the team as a whole will need to make 
some decisions. Following on from SET08103 Software Engineering Methods (SEM), we will 
be using Scrum, so the first decision that needs to be take is who will be the Scrum 
Master this week.

The majority of people will have done SET08103, but some may be direct entrants and
will not have done that module. As a team, you will need to organise a buddy system
which pairs experienced people with less experienced people to help bring them up to
speed.

We will be using C# and Visual Studio (VS). Similarly, some people will have experience 
with that IDE but some may not. You will need to organise a similar buddy system to help
those who are unfamiliar with VS find their way around. If you can combine the two 
requirements (SEM & VS) it will make your familiarisation process more efficient.

## Documentation

The one content requirement for this week is to create a documentation folder in the
shared repository and create a document called `setup.md` containing instructions
on how to set up a personal working environment. You need to decide on the best
approach for doing this as a team, but the content needs to be checked to make sure
that the instructions are clear and correct.

## The scenario

The last task this week is to read about the requirements for the team development 
project so that you understand it at least in outline. It has been specifically
chosen because it is very complex. It is unlikely that you will be able to fully
understand every aspect on one reading. You can find the details on the 
[scenario page](scenario.md).
