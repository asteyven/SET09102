# Code review

*Under development*

This week sees a break from the teamwork. Instead, you will be completing a series
of online code review challenges. For each challenge, you need to identify the 
problems with a code snippet and suggest a way to fix them. The challenges increase
in difficulty as you go through the series. You will accumulate a points score as 
you go through them - don't skip ahead, otherwise you will miss out on points from
the early ones.

## Documentation

At the end of the week, the team needs to review their workflow documentation to include
the code review stage. The `workflow.md` file needs to be updated with clear instructions
for how to 

* assign a reviewer
* perform the code review
* respond to a code review
* close an issue
