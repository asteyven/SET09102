# Clean code and documentation

*Under development*

The purpose of this practical is to explore the concept of clean code before putting 
it into practice in your team project. The exercise comes in several parts. The first
takes the same form as the code review exercises last week where you are presented 
with a code snippet and you have to identify the problems with it and suggests fixes.
The difference is that the problems are all related to the principles of clean code.
Again, you will accumulate points for the challenges completed which will be added
to your code review score.

The second part is to review the code created by someone else in week 2. You need
to look for all problems, but pay special attention to whether the code adheres to
the clean code principles or not.

In the third and last part, you will correct any problems with the code that you
wrote in week 2 in response to its review comments and add documentation.
