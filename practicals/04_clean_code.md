# Clean code and documentation

The purpose of this practical is to explore the concept of clean code before putting 
it into practice in your team project. The exercise comes in several parts. The first
is to review the code that you wrote in week 3. Have you used the principles of clean
code? If not, what improvements could you make? 

The second part is to use Doxygen to generate a set of documentation for the entire 
project. You should embed comments into the code that provide useful information
about any aspects that are not covered by the code itself.

To complete parts one and two, you will need to create a new issue in GitHub and 
assign it to yourself. Then you need to follow your team workflow to complete the
changes.

In the third and last part, you will review someone else's code and provide feedback
comments. At the same time, someone else will review your changes and if they identify
any improvements that could be made, you should make the changes and request another 
review. Once the reviewer is satisfied, you can go ahead and merge your changes into the 
main branch. 

## Process documentation

The final task of this week is to make some decisions as a team as to exactly what
additional comments to include in the source code. This should be specified in a file 
called `doxygen.md` in your team documentation folder. One person on the team should 
create the file but everyone should contribute to the discussion of what it should
include.
