# Establishing a team workflow

*Under development*

The purpose of this practical is to continue with the team startup process. There are
four main tasks:

* Decide on a standard team workflow that everyone should follow when working on a
  GitHub issue
* Import the list of issues into your team project
* Choose a relatively simple issue for each person on the team to work on and complete
  it following the team workflow
* Implement continuous integration (CI)

Once the team has decided on the workflow, it needs to described in a file called 
`workflow.md` in the documentation folder.
