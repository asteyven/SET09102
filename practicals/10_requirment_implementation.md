# Requirements Implementation

*Under development*

This week, you will be assigned an issue that has been elaborated by someone else on the 
team. Your task is to follow the team workflow as usual to try to complete it. If you need 
clarification of the requirement, or if you think there is an error, you can ask the person
who elaborated the user story to make changes. This should be done by editing the related 
GitHub issue(s) so that a history of changes is captured. Likewise, if the person 
implementing the user story that you elaborated asks for help, you need to down tools
and fix your specification before continuing with your own development work.

In completing the task, you should follow the team workflow through to completion including
code review. You will also be asked to review someone else's code. This is the last piece of 
development that you will do for the module, and for that reason it should be your best work.
In your interview at the end of the module, the tutor will focus heavily on this item in
your portfolio.
