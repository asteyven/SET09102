# Project work

*Under development*

In weeks 6 - 8, the practical exercise is directly related to your team project. 
Each week, each person on the team should 

* accept an issue from the backlog
* follow the team workflow through to pull request
* add documentation for the changes
* review someone else's work
* fix any problems identified in the review of your own code

The idea is to put into practice all the aspects that we have looked at so far. With each 
issue that you deal with you should be looking for ways to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the work. That includes

* Your personal skills with code design, unit testing, documentation and code review
* The processes that your team has adopted

At the end of each week, the team should review the agreed processes including workflow, 
communication, documentation, etc. to identify opportunities to improve them. Changes 
should be captured in a new version of the documentation file `workflow.md`. Once changes
have been made, all team members are expected to follow the new procedures.
