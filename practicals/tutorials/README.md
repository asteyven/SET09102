# Tutorials

The materials in this folder comprise a mixture of Microsoft tutorials and ones that have
been specially built for this module. They start with the implementation of a simple notes
application which is developed in a series of steps to add more sophisticated features.

The first takes you through the steps to create a simple notes application which
stores notes as text files. The second tutorials guides you through the process of upgrading
the app to use the MVVM pattern rather than the simple code-behind approach. The third tutorial
shows you how to upgrade your app to use a local SQLite database instead. They take roughly an
hour each.
