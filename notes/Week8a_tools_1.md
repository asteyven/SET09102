> Tools can help your team enforce your standards. You can enable any of the 
[Code analysis tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview) 
to enforce the rules you prefer. You can also create an 
[`editorconfig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options) 
so that Visual Studio automatically enforces your style guidelines. You can start by 
using the [dotnet/docs](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/.editorconfig) 
to use our style as a starting point.
