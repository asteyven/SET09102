# Assessment details

There are two components of assessment in this module. That means that you need to 
achieve at least 30% in each component and a combined mark of 40% or more overall to 
pass.

Component 1 is a [portfolio](portfolio.md) related to the practical work of the module. 
There is an entry for each of the ten teaching weeks of the module, and each one needs 
to be completed within the relevant week.

> ### Please note
> 
> * The material in your portfolio should document your own work. Where the practical
>   exercise involves working with others, it is your personal contribution that should be
>   discussed. It is *not* appropriate to present someone else's work as yours. That would
>   be a clear breach of the 
>   [academic regulations](https://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/dlte/regulations/Pages/Regulations.aspx). 
> * Likewise, it is also a breach of the regulations to claim that something is true when 
>   it is not (see [Appendix I, paragraph 6](https://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/dlte/Regulations/Documents/2023-24/Student_Conduct_2023_24_Final.pdf)). 
>   If you have not completed the required work, but you submit a portfolio entry 
>   that makes it appear that you did, you may be in breach. If this situation arises, you 
>   will be asked to explain what happened to the Module Leader and your portfolio entry may
>   be discounted.
> 
> You can also look at the university policy and description of 
> [Academic Misconduct](https://www.napierstudents.com/advice/education/academicmisconduct/) and 
> [Academic Integrity](https://my.napier.ac.uk/your-studies/improve-your-academic-and-study-skills/referencing-and-academic-integrity/academic-integrity)

Component 2 is a 15-minute, one-to-one [interview](interview.md). The questions will 
relate to the content of your portfolio. The purpose of the interview is to assess your 
abilities related to the module's learning outcomes which are to

1. Explain software quality in both formal and informal terms
2. Apply design and development practices to optimise the quality of software systems
3. Evaluate software quality
4. Critique software development processes

Please see the assessment briefs for more details.
