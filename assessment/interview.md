## Assessment Specification

The purpose of this assessment is to explore your understanding of the module content
using your portfolio as evidence. The interview will last approximately 15 minutes
during which time a tutor will ask you questions based on your portfolio that are 
designed to test your achievement of the module learning outcomes, i.e. you ability
to

1. Explain software quality in both formal and informal terms
2. Apply design and development practices to optimise the quality of software systems
3. Evaluate software quality
4. Critique software development processes

Interviews will take place during weeks 13 and 14. The actual schedule will be
arranged during week 11.

## Special arrangements

If your learning profile indicates that this type of assessment may cause undue
anxiety or may put you at some other disadvantage, please bring this to the attention
of the Module Leader before the end of week 11. In most cases, the Module Leader will
already be aware of your requirements from your learning profile, but making direct
contact as well ensures that no-one's requirements are overlooked. 

In most cases, the proposed modification is to provide an opportunity for a practice
interview in advance of the real thing. This will let you see what the experience will
be like and will allow you to prepare appropriately. In addition, you will be able to 
have another person present to support you during the interview to help you to
interpret the questions appropriately. The specific arrangements for your interview
will be confirmed before the end of week 12.

The unifying principle behind the module is the concept of quality. Therefore, one
of the most important elements of your portfolio is the final pair of code reviews - 
the one that you perform and the one that you receive. However, you should also
be prepared for questions on any entry in your portfolio right back to the setup entry
in week 2.

## Preparation and formative feedback

Over the course of the practical sessions, the module tutors will speak with every 
student individually on at least one occasion to test their progress towards the 
learning outcomes. You need to take advantage of this opportunity to practice using
professional language and technical terminology to demonstrate your understanding
of the module content. The tutors will provide feedback on your performance as well
as advice on how to improve.

Preparation for the interview will be discussed in the lecture in week 12. A series
of example questions will also be provided to help with your preparations. Please
note, however, that the list will not be comprehensive. Some of the questions may 
come up during your interview, but there will also be other questions not on the list.
This is to ensure that students do not simply memorise prepared answers. The interview
is intended to provide an accurate picture of your knowledge and understanding of the 
module content and that requires a certain degree of spontaneity.
