## Assessment Specification

The purpose of this assessment is to explore your understanding of the module content
using your portfolio as evidence. The interview will last approximately 15 minutes
during which time a tutor will ask you questions based on your portfolio that are 
designed to test your achievement of the module learning outcomes, i.e. your ability
to

1. Explain software quality in both formal and informal terms
2. Apply design and development practices to optimise the quality of software systems
3. Evaluate software quality
4. Critique software development processes

Interviews will take place during weeks 13 and 14. The actual schedule will be
arranged during week 11.

## Special arrangements

If your learning profile indicates that this type of assessment may cause undue
anxiety or may put you at some other disadvantage, please bring this to the attention
of the Module Leader before the end of week 11. In most cases, the Module Leader will
already be aware of your requirements from your learning profile, but making direct
contact as well ensures that no-one's requirements are overlooked. 

In most cases, the proposed modification is to provide an opportunity for a practice
interview in advance of the real thing. This will let you see what the experience will
be like and will allow you to prepare appropriately. In addition, you will be able to 
have another person present to support you during the interview to help you to
interpret the questions appropriately. The specific arrangements for your interview
will be confirmed before the end of week 12.

The unifying principle behind the module is the concept of quality. Therefore, one
of the most important elements of your portfolio is the final pair of code reviews - 
the one that you perform and the one that you receive. However, you should also
be prepared for questions on any entry in your portfolio right back to the setup entry
in week 2.

## Preparation and formative feedback

Over the course of the practical sessions, the module tutors will speak with every 
student individually on at least one occasion to test their progress towards the 
learning outcomes. You need to take advantage of this opportunity to practice using
professional language and technical terminology to demonstrate your understanding
of the module content. The tutors will provide feedback on your performance as well
as advice on how to improve.

Preparation for the interview will be discussed in the lecture in week 12. A series
of example questions will also be provided to help with your preparations. Please
note, however, that the list will not be comprehensive. Some of the questions may 
come up during your interview, but there will also be other questions not on the list.
This is to ensure that students do not simply memorise prepared answers. The interview
is intended to provide an accurate picture of your knowledge and understanding of the 
module content and that requires a certain degree of spontaneity.

## Learning outcomes

This section provides advice specific to each of the four learning outcomes with examples of 
possible interview questions. Please not though that these are example questions only - you 
may get other similar questions that are not on the list. When answering any question there 
are some points to remember:

* A one-word or one-sentence answer is not enough. You must be prepared elaborate your
  response with references to background theory, practical examples, material from
  your portfolio, etc. Remember that the point of the exercise is to demonstrate how
  much you know about a topic.
* Using correct terminology is much better than using informal language. Being confident 
  in your use of appropriate terms helps to show the depth of your understanding. Informal
  language, on the other hand, suggests that you only have a vague understanding.
* Be precise in fitting your answer to the question. If you give an answer that does not
  correspond directly to the question, it can be interpreted as a lack of understanding
  of the topic in question. If you need clarification on the meaning of a question, you
  should ask.
* Try to structure your responses well. If you like, you may spend a few seconds making 
  notes before answering. This must be done on paper, however - you should not rely on a 
  web browser or any other online material to provide inspiration for your answer. Your
  answer should highlight one or more main points and come to a clear conclusion without
  rambling.

### 1. Explain software quality in both formal and informal terms

To satisfy this leaning outcome, you need to be able to explain what the term *quality*
means in the context of software engineering. There are informal explanations that refer
to some of the non-functional characteristics of software systems such as *security*,
*maintainability*, etc. If you want to use these concepts in your explanation, you should
be prepared to explain what they mean, to provide examples and discuss the characteristics
of code that enhance them.

There are also formal definitions of quality that can be found in the relevant standards
documents. If you want to make reference to these definitions, you should be prepared to
explain the source of the standard (e.g. international standards organisation, industry
consortium, etc.), and to discuss their impact on the way application code is written
and structured.

### 2. Apply design and development practices to optimise the quality of software systems

Whereas learning outcome 1 is about the meaning of the term *quality* in the context of 
software engineering, this one is about how an individual developer or a development team
can maximise the quality of their output. That is, it is about *practice* and *process*.
There are several dimensions that can be explored to satisfy this learning outcome including

* Personal workflow definition
* Team workflow and coordination
* Making use of appropriate tools
* Demonstrating knowledge of standards and frameworks

### 3. Evaluate software quality

To be able to manage something, the first step is to be able to measure it. This learning
outcome is related to your understanding of how code quality can be measured. You should be 
prepared to describe relevant metrics and processes, and to discuss their usefulness and
limitations. You should include *qualitative* evaluation criteria such as *readability*
as well as *quantitative* metrics such as *cyclomatic complexity*.

<br/>

* Give an example of a qualitative code quality metric and explain its use
* Contrast the usefulness of two different code quality metrics
</details>

### 4. Critique software development processes

This learning outcome draws on the reflective commentary from your portfolio entries. It tests
your ability to identify limitations of existing processes, and to identify potential 
improvements. It also tests your knowledge of coordination tools such as GitHub that can be
used to streamline development process. To answer a question in this area, you can draw on 
personal experience working with your team, and you can also use theoretical material on 
process management such as branching strategies and DevOps. Both of these are valuable, but 
the idea is to be able to combine the two.
